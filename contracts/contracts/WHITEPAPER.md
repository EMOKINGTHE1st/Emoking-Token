## Key Features

- 🔒 **Anti-Sniper Logic:**  
  First 10 mins after liquidity add → All buyers = blacklisted bots  
  These funds are used later to increase LP.

- 🧠 **Max Wallet Limit:**  
  No wallet can hold over 5 million $KING (0.5%).

- 🛡️ **Blacklist Protection:**  
  Whales or malicious wallets can be blacklisted if needed.

- 🔧 **Ownership:**  
  Still owned. Will be **renounced after CG + CMC + LP lock**.

---

## Liquidity Status

- LP added manually by the deployer.  
- Will be locked after we reach CG and holder volume milestone.
